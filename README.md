# SQL-Employee-Tracker
This is a command line application that can be used by companies to update, search and view an employee tracker database. When prompted, the user will be presented a series of categories where they can specify the task they need done. The user can view departments, view employees, view roles as well as adding additional information to all those categories! This allows the user to access a database that can easily store information for future use.

This application uses MySQL and inquirer.
